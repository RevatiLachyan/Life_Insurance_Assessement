Question: 'Use this prudential data set to determine the risk factor: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/prudential-life-insurance-assessmentLinks to an external site..

Apply FOUR different machine learning techniques and evaluate on the test data set and compare their performances. Note that the output variable is an ordinal variable. Hence treat the problem either as a regression problem or convert it to a bunch of binary classification problems. Perhaps two in a group of four try as a regression and the other two try as a binary classification problem but prepare/ETL the data only once. Reduce the dimensionality of the data as needed.'

Downloaded the data and imported it as CSV.
Checked the data and labelled the type of data as applicable.
